# Hi, my name is William ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Augmented Reality Research Intern at Bosch. I enjoy solving problems in systems and natural language, and I have a fondness for interesting visualizations and clever math as well.

Outside of technology, I keep up with competitive video games, make arrangements of my favorite songs, and dabble in recreational mathematics.

Iâ€™d love to chat â€“ feel free to send me an email at [wm274@cornell.edu](mailto:wm274@cornell.edu).
