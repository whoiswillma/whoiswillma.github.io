# Hi, my name is William 👋

I am a backend software engineer at Ramp. I enjoy tackling problems in (operating/distributed) systems and (programming/natural) languages, and I have a particular fondness for interesting visualizations and clever math.

Outside of technology, I keep up with competitive video games, make arrangements of my favorite songs, and dabble in recreational mathematics.

I’d love to chat – send me an email at [wm274@cornell.edu](mailto:wm274@cornell.edu).
