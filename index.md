# Hi, my name is William 👋

I'm an Augmented Reality Research Intern at Bosch. I enjoy solving problems in systems and natural language, and I have a fondness for interesting visualizations and clever math as well.

Outside of technology, I keep up with competitive video games, make arrangements of my favorite songs, and dabble in recreational mathematics.

I’d love to chat – feel free to send me an email at [wm274@cornell.edu](mailto:wm274@cornell.edu).

_I am actively looking for software engineering positions to start in January 2023!_
