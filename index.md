# Introduction

My name is William Ma and I'm a student at Cornell University studying Computer Science in the College of Engineering. On campus, I'm a project leader and iOS developer for [Cornell AppDev](https://www.cornellappdev.com/). Academically, my interests lie in compilers, computability theory, and algorithmic theory. Outside of academics, I enjoy singing, cooking, listening to podcasts, and playing video games.

## Projects
 * [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (2020 - Present) - As part of the [MLH Fellowship](https://fellowship.mlh.io/), I added license information to homebrew packages and integrated brew cask more closely with core homebrew
 * [Eatery](https://www.cornellappdev.com/eatery) (2018 - Present) - An app to view dining hall hours and menus. As an iOS developer, I architected multiple systems and refactored the UI to be entirely programmatic. From 2018 to 2020, I helped grow the userbase by about 20% to 7500 monthly-active users.
 * Xi Compiler (Spring 2020 Semeseter, [CS 4120](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4120/2020sp/)) - A compiler for an imperative C-like programming language. Includes lexing with JFlex, parsing with CUP, type-checking, mid-level IR generation, low-level IR generation and optimization, and assembly code generation with register allocation.
