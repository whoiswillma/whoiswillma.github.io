% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by

% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}

\location{ I am an open-source contributor to a package manager for macOS, an experienced iOS developer working on an on-campus dining app, and an academic student interested in compilers, computability theory, and algorithms. }

% \location{ I am an open-source contributor interested in developer tools and solid testing. I contributed to Homebrew by adding license information to nearly half of core Homebrew packages, and unified the commands of Homebrew and its sibling project, \texttt{brew cask} }

% \location{ I am an experienced iOS developer and design enthusiast. I am a project manager and frontend developer for Eatery, an app used by 50\% of students at Cornell. }

% \location{ I am interested in compilers, computability theory, and algorithmic theory. The Xi Compiler I helped build compiles a type-checked LALR language into x86 assembly with dataflow analysis-based optimizations. }
